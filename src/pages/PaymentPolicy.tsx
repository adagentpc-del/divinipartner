      <div style={eff}>Effective June 24, 2026</div>

      <p>
        This Payment Policy is part of the Divini Partners{' '}
        <Link to="/terms" style={a}>Terms of Service</Link> and explains how payments work on the
        Platform. Divini Partners is a lead-generation and networking technology platform. It is not
        a bank, escrow agent, money transmitter, or party to any transaction between users.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>Third-party processing</h2>
      <p>
        Payments are processed by one or more independent third-party payment processors. Your
        payments are subject to those processors' terms and privacy policies.
        Divini Partners does not take custody of transaction funds as principal and does not control
        settlement, holds, or payout timing imposed by a processor or financial institution.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>Platform fee</h2>
      <p>
        A flat platform fee is added at checkout, on top of the vendor's price. The vendor receives
        their full quoted amount; the client sees the fee clearly before paying. The platform fee is
        a technology and facilitation fee for use of the Platform and is non-refundable except where
        required by law.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>Refunds, cancellations, and chargebacks</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds and cancellations are governed by the agreement between the transacting users and by
        the applicable processor's policies. Divini Partners does not issue refunds for services it
        does not provide and is not responsible for chargebacks, reversals, disputed charges, or
        non-payment between users. Any such matter is resolved between the users and, where relevant,
        the payment processor.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>Taxes</h2>
      <p>
        Each user is solely responsible for determining, collecting, reporting, and remitting any
        taxes applicable to their own transactions.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>On-platform payment requirement</h2>
      <p>
        Transactions sourced or coordinated through the Platform are expected to be paid through the
        Platform so the applicable fee applies. Attempting to move a Platform-sourced relationship
        off-platform to avoid fees is addressed in our{' '}
        <Link to="/non-circumvention" style={a}>Non-Circumvention Policy</Link>.
