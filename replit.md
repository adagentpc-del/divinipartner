# A3 Partner Commerce Portal

## Overview

Full-stack web app for A3 Visual (premium event production company), expanded into a multi-supplier commerce portal. Supports two partner types:
- **Branding partners** (e.g. Move Miami, Hilton): venue branding map portals + multi-step intake forms.
- **Ordering partners** (e.g. Social Commerce Festival): full ordering flow with cities/venues/events, tiered packages, add-ons, artwork upload, and order tracking.

Includes admin dashboards for partners, suppliers, cities/venues, events, packages (with items), inventory, orders (with internal packets), users & roles, and a vendor fulfillment view. Suppliers are auto-assigned to orders via the partner's `defaultSupplierId`.

pnpm workspace monorepo using TypeScript. Each package manages its own dependencies.

## Architecture

### Artifacts
- `artifacts/api-server` — Express API server (port 8080)
- `artifacts/a3-portal` — React + Vite frontend (previewPath `/`)

### Quote Ingestion & Catalog Intelligence
A workflow for turning supplier quotes, spec sheets, screenshots, ERP exports, and notes into structured catalog data. Built on top of the existing `quote_assets` table — no rewrite.

**Schema (`lib/db/src/schema/quoteAssets.ts`)**
- `quote_assets` extended: `sourceType` (quote / spec_sheet / screenshot / website_reference / erp_export / manual_note / prior_job_reference), `processingStatus` (new / needs_review / needs_clarification / mapped / approved / superseded / archived), structured `supplierId` (FK), `confidenceFlag`, all extracted enrichment fields (extractedDisplayName/InternalName/Category, customerFacingSummary, backendOpsSummary, finishingSummary, leadTimeText, printFileRequirements, install/opsNotes, reviewNotes, clarificationNeeded, missingDataFlagsJson).
- `quote_asset_mappings` — m2m linking a source to product / package / branding_zone / supplier.
- `product_spec_standards` — standardized spec records per product, with one `isCurrent` (preferred), supplier/zone/package scoping, full summaries, lead time, approval/active/effective/expiration, sourceQuoteAssetIds, missingDataFlagsJson.
- `product_catalog` extended: `customerFacingSummary`, `reviewStatus`, `missingDataFlagsJson`.

**API (`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/quoteAssets.ts`)**
- Enriched `/api/quote-assets` GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE with filters: sourceType, processingStatus, supplierId, mappingStatus, missingDataOnly, expiredOnly, search.
- `/api/quote-ingestion/stats` — dashboard counts.
- `/api/quote-assets/bulk-update` — batch processingStatus / supplier patch.
- `/api/quote-assets/:id/mappings` GET/POST + `/mappings/:mid` DELETE — chip-style m2m.
- `/api/quote-assets/:id/promote` — creates a new product (and optional preferred spec standard) from a source, auto-maps it.
- `/api/products/:id/spec-standards` CRUD + `/spec-standards/:sid/set-current` — catalog spec standardization.
- `/api/catalog-intelligence/overview` — products with missing data, expired sources, products without an approved standard, multi-supplier products.

**UI**
- `pages/admin/QuoteIngestion.tsx` at `/admin/quote-ingestion` (nav: "Ingestion") — stat cards, filter rail, source cards with checkbox bulk-select, file upload via `/api/storage/uploads/request-url`, side drawer with Enrich / Mappings / Review tabs, missing-data flag chips, Promote-to-product dialog.
- `pages/admin/ProductCatalog.tsx` — added `Spec Standards` tab (list with starred current preferred + inline editor), customer-facing summary field, internal Intelligence panel (review status pill + missing-data flag chips). Quote tab renamed "Sources".

## Request Statuses
### Legacy intake requests:
New, Reviewing, Waiting for files, Waiting for dimensions, Quote prep, Quote sent, Follow up, Closed won, Closed lost

### Portal requests (new):
new, reviewing, quoted, awaiting artwork, in production, completed, archived

### Quote statuses:
needs_review, quoting, quote_sent, awaiting_approval, approved, declined

### Priority levels:
normal, high, urgent

## Design System
- **Primary color**: Dark navy (`222 47% 11%`) — professional, premium
- **Dark mode accent**: Warm gold (`45 93% 58%`)
- **Typography**: Inter (Google Fonts), with font-feature-settings for refined glyphs
- **Border radius**: 0.625rem base
- **Status badges**: Color-coded (blue=New, amber=Reviewing, violet=Quote prep, emerald=Quote sent, green=Won, red=Lost)
- **Partner portal**: Partner branding primary, "Powered by A3" subtle badge; trust signals on step 1; animated step transitions
- **Admin**: Compact horizontal nav with backdrop blur header; rounded card-based layouts; icon + text for section headers

## Quote & Production Workflow
- All portal/product/branding request tables include: estimatedPrice, costNotes, quoteSummary, turnaroundNotes, quoteReady, quoteStatus
- Production handoff fields: productionOwner, installRequired, productionNotes, fulfillmentNotes, vendorNotes, productionDeadline, priority, recurringEvent
- Legacy requests table has: estimatedPrice, quoteStatus, quoteSummary, quoteReady, productionOwner, priority
- Admin detail page has collapsible "Quote & Pricing" and "Production & Handoff" panels
- Quote summary generator builds structured text block from request data, copy-to-clipboard
- All internal fields are never exposed to public portal

## Security & Hardening
- **File upload validation**: Client-side (50MB limit, extension whitelist) + server-side (`isValidStoragePath` rejects external URLs, path traversal)
- **SSRF mitigation**: Deck extraction rejects external http URLs; only object storage paths accepted
- **Error handling**: All admin mutations (status, notes, extraction items) show destructive toasts on failure
- **Submit errors**: RequestFormDialog surfaces upload failures and API errors inline
- **Server-side file URL validation**: `saveFiles()` in portalRequests.ts validates all file URLs before DB insert

## API Enrichment
- `GET /product-requests` — LEFT JOIN with product_catalog for `productName`
- `GET /branding-requests` — LEFT JOIN with partner_branding_locations for `locationName`
- `GET /product-requests/:id` — Includes full `product` object (name, category, imageUrl)
- `GET /branding-requests/:id` — Includes full `location` object (name, category, dimensions, preview image)

## Seed Data
2 sample partners (Move Miami, Hilton), 34 pricing rules across 6 categories, 22 products, 6 portal sections for Move Miami, 1 partner theme.

## Partner Commerce Portal (April 2026)
Expanded into a multi-supplier ordering & branding platform.

- **Partner types** (`partners.partnerType`): `branding` (zones/venues — Move Miami, Hilton) vs `ordering` (cities/events/packages — Social Commerce Festival).
- **Portal modes** (`partners.portalMode`): `intake`, `full`, `ordering` — each renders a different public `/partner/:slug` experience.
- **Admin nav is portal-type aware**: PartnerForm shows Branding Zones for branding partners; Cities & Venues / Events / Packages for ordering partners.
- **Dashboard** (`/api/dashboard/summary`): partner counts + type mix, total/pending/unassigned/today orders, partner-type breakdown, low-inventory alerts, upcoming events, recent orders & partners. Frontend uses direct `apiFetch` + react-query.
- **Ordering portal** (`/pages/public/OrderingPortal.tsx`): 6-step stepper (Event → Package → Add-ons → Artwork → Contact → Review) with sticky right-side summary sidebar (event/package/cart/total) on desktop. Public POST `/orders` uses strict Zod validation + transactional insert.
- **OrderDetail**: structured panels (Partner / Event / Shipping / Items / Artwork / Internal) with print-friendly stylesheet (`window.print()` hides nav/sidebars and renders an order packet header).
- **PartnerForm wizard**: sticky stepper bar (Basics → Portal → Documents → Contact → Settings) with anchor links and section step labels.
- **Duplicate actions**: Events, Packages, Partners all have `POST /api/{resource}/:id/duplicate` and "Duplicate" buttons in admin lists.
- **New schema columns**: `partners.partnerType`, `partners.defaultSupplierId` (both validated in partners route).

## Self-Service Onboarding (April 2026)
Public, shareable onboarding form for prospective clients to submit their info; admin reviews and one-click converts into a partner.

- **Public URL**: `/onboard` (no auth) — 6-step wizard: Company → Portal Type → Brand & Visuals → Contact → Billing → Review.
- **Logo & brand asset uploads** go through the existing presigned-URL storage flow (`/api/storage/uploads/request-url`).
- **Schema**: `partner_onboarding_submissions` (in `lib/db/src/schema/partnerOnboardingSubmissions.ts`) captures company, partner type, portal mode, tours flag, branding assets/copy, primary + billing contacts, payment terms, goals, and review lifecycle (`status`: new/reviewing/approved/rejected/converted, `internalNotes`, `convertedPartnerId`).
- **API** (`/api/onboarding/*`): public `POST /submit` (strict Zod), admin `GET /submissions`, `GET /submissions/:id`, `PATCH /submissions/:id` (status + notes), `POST /submissions/:id/convert` (creates a partner with `isActive=false`, auto-deduplicated slug, billing info populated, and links the submission via `convertedPartnerId`).
- **Admin UI**: `/admin/onboarding` shows the shareable link with a "Copy" button, status counters, and a list of submissions. Clicking opens a polished review dialog with sectioned details (Company / Brand / Contact / Billing / Goals), logo previews, internal notes, and "Convert to Partner" action that opens the new partner editor.

## Reusable Hardware & Asset Inventory (April 2026)
Lightweight but real reusable-event inventory system for partner-owned hardware (tables, easy-up frames, banner bases, step-and-repeat hardware, display hardware, etc.).

- **Schema** (`lib/db/src/schema/inventory.ts`):
  - `inventory` table now carries asset metadata: `name`, `category`, `assetType` (`hardware` | `reusable_asset`), `storageLocation`, optional `partnerId` (owner) and optional `productId` (catalog link).
  - Quantity columns: `totalQuantity`, `reserved`, `inUse`, `damaged`, `retired`, `onOrder`, plus `reorderThreshold`. Legacy `hardwareOnHand` / `lowInventoryThreshold` are kept for back-compat and auto-mirrored on writes.
  - Computed (server-side): `available = max(0, total − reserved − inUse − damaged − retired)`, plus `isLow` and `overcommitted` flags.
  - New `inventory_reservations` table links `inventoryId` ↔ `eventId` with `quantity`, `status` (`active` | `released` | `fulfilled`), and notes.
- **API** (`/api/inventory/*`):
  - CRUD on assets with the extended fields.
  - `GET /inventory/shortages` returns rows that are low or overcommitted (powers replenishment views).
  - `GET /inventory/reservations?eventId=…&inventoryId=…` lists reservations with joined event/inventory/city/product names.
  - `POST /inventory/reservations` creates a reservation **transactionally** and increments `inventoryTable.reserved`.
  - `PATCH /inventory/reservations/:id` adjusts status/quantity and re-balances `reserved` vs `inUse` deltas atomically (releasing or fulfilling moves the right counters).
  - `DELETE /inventory/reservations/:id` reverses the live count it was holding.
- **Admin UI** (`/admin/inventory`):
  - Six summary stat cards (Total Assets, Reserved, In Use, On Order, Low Stock, Overcommitted) with tone-coded warnings.
  - Tabs: **Overview** (asset cards), **By City** (grouped with per-city totals), **Shortages** (recommended replenishment), **Reservations** (active + in-use lists with one-click release / mark-in-use / return).
  - Search + city + partner filters.
  - Asset cards show colored Available block, breakdown chips for damaged/retired/on-order, and inline alerts when low or overcommitted.
  - Add/edit dialog includes live "available" preview and an immediate over-commit warning before saving.
- **Event reservation flow**: each event card on `/admin/partners/:id/events` exposes a Boxes icon that opens `EventInventoryDialog` (`src/components/admin/EventInventoryDialog.tsx`) — pick city → pick asset (shows available/total) → set qty → see "✓ Enough available" or "⚠ Shortfall: order N more" before confirming. Lists all reservations for the event with status badges and quick actions.

## Order Fulfillment Engine, Catalog Intelligence & Quote Mapping (April 2026)
Connects fulfillment modes to inventory reservations, surfaces partner committed inventory, and adds catalog/quote intelligence.

### Schema additions
- `productCatalog`: capability flags `usePartnerInventoryEligible`, `reusableHardwareCompatible`, `inventoryTracked`, `requiresAttachmentSelection`, `requiresMaterialSelection`; ops fields `installNotes`, `internalOpsSummary`, `featureBadgesJson` (string[]).
- `orderItems`: fulfillment math columns `hardwareRequired`, `printDemandQuantity`, `hardwareDemandQuantity`, `reservedQuantity`, `shortageQuantity`, `inventorySourceCityId`, `inventorySourceInventoryId`, `inventoryReservationId`, `internalFulfillmentNotes`.
- `quoteAssets`: `dimensionsSummary`, `materialSummary`, `attachmentSummary`, `hardwareSummary`, `supplierName` (in addition to existing version/effective/expiration/approved-standard fields).
- `inventory` unique index relaxed to `(cityId, partnerId, productId, name)` to support per-partner ownership.

### Fulfillment engine (`/api/orders`)
- `computeFulfillmentMath(item, productCaps)` derives `printDemand` / `hardwareDemand` / `hardwareRequired` from `fulfillmentMode` × product capabilities. Modes: `full` (print + hardware), `graphic_only` (print only), `use_existing_partner_inventory` (print + reserve from owned hardware), `rental_plus_print`, `new_hardware_required`, legacy `client_owned_plus_print`.
- POST/PATCH `/orders` automatically: when an item has `fulfillmentMode = use_existing_partner_inventory`, an `eventId`, and `inventorySourceInventoryId`, it transactionally `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`s the inventory row, creates a reservation for `min(qty, available)`, persists `inventoryReservationId`, `reservedQuantity`, and any `shortageQuantity` on the item.
- PATCH rebalances reservations when mode/qty/source changes (releases the prior reservation before creating a new one).
- DELETE `/orders/:id` releases all reservations atomically before removing the order.
- New list filters on `GET /orders`: `fulfillmentMode`, `shortageOnly` (accepts `1` / `true`), `reservedOnly`, `sourceCityId`. List rows include `totalShortage`, `totalReserved`, `itemFulfillmentModes` aggregate.

### Catalog intelligence (admin Dashboard)
`/api/dashboard/summary` adds: `partnerInventoryOrders`, `printOnlyOrders`, `ordersWithShortages`, `totalShortageUnits`, `productsMissingQuote`. Admin Dashboard renders a "Catalog Intelligence" row of stat cards that deep-link into pre-filtered Orders list.

### Partner committed-inventory view
- API: `GET /partners/:id/inventory-summary` returns enriched assets (with derived `available`, `isLow`, `overcommitted`, `displayName`), per-city aggregates, all reservations, and an `upcomingByEvent` rollup with status counts and total committed units.
- UI: `/admin/partners/:id/committed-inventory` (linked from the PartnersList Boxes icon). Tabs: **By city** (per-city cards with available/reserved/in-use/low breakdown), **Upcoming commitments** (event timeline with status chips), **Shortages** (over-committed and low items), **All assets** (flat list).

### Product Catalog UI
- `/admin/products` rewritten with grouped-by-category cards showing capability badges (Hardware / Graphic only / Rental / Partner-owned / Reusable HW / Tracked / lead-time).
- Edit dialog has 4 tabs: **Customer-facing** (display name, dimensions, description, badges, gallery), **Capabilities** (all eight capability flags + active/orderable toggles), **Backend Ops** (attachment method, material, finishing, lead time, production/install/internal notes), **Quote / Spec** (inline `QuoteAssetsPanel` for uploading and managing supplier quotes/spec sheets — version, effective/expiration dates, approved-standard star, vendor visibility, dimensions/material/attachment/hardware summaries, file upload via presigned URL).

### Order Detail (per-item fulfillment view)
- Top-of-page shortage banner appears when any item has `shortageQuantity > 0`.
- Order-level totals row: Print demand, Hardware demand, Reserved-from-inventory, Shortage.
- Each item card shows: fulfillment-mode badge, print/hardware demand chips, reservation badge with reservation id, source-city badge, and inline approved quote/spec links pulled from the product (`ProductSpecRefs`).

### Filters & widgets
- `/admin/orders` has new filter row: fulfillment-mode select, source-city select, "Shortages only" toggle. Mode column now shows per-item modes plus reserved/shortage counters.

### Verified end-to-end
Order `qty=7` of an asset with 5 available → `reservedQuantity=5`, `shortageQuantity=2`, inventory `reserved` 0→5; order delete releases the reservation back to 0.

See the `pnpm-workspace` skill for workspace structure, TypeScript setup, and package details.

## Multi-Supplier Routing & Fulfillment Workflow (April 2026)

The portal supports per-line-item supplier routing on top of the order-level supplier. Every order item carries its own supplier, status, dates, and exception state, with a full audit trail.

### Schema additions
- `partnerBrandingLocations.defaultSupplierId` — preferred supplier for items pulled from a branding zone.
- `orderItems` (new columns): `assignedSupplierId`, `supplierAssignmentSource` (`product|package|zone|order|manual|none`), `supplierStatus` (12-value enum), `supplierDueDate`, `supplierShipDate`, `supplierDeliveryDate`, `supplierInstallDate`, `supplierAcknowledgedAt`, `supplierReference`, `supplierNotes`, `exceptionFlag`, `exceptionReason`, `exceptionNotes`.
- `supplier_assignment_history` — every supplier change (from→to, source, note, user, timestamp).
- `supplier_status_events` — every status change (from→to, role, note, user, timestamp).

### Inheritance order (resolved server-side on item create/update)
`product.supplierId` → `partnerBrandingLocations.defaultSupplierId` (zone) → `orders.assignedSupplierId` (order-level) → `none`. Manual overrides set `supplierAssignmentSource = 'manual'` and are preserved on later edits.

### Status model
`unassigned → assigned → acknowledged → in_production → (awaiting_assets | awaiting_approval) → shipped → delivered → installed → completed`. `issue_flagged` is an orthogonal exception state. Vendors are restricted to a forward-only transition table; admins can set any status.

### API routes (under `/api`)
- `POST /orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/assign-supplier` `{ supplierId, source?, note? }`
- `POST /orders/:orderId/bulk-assign-supplier` `{ itemIds[], supplierId, source? }`
- `POST /orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/status` `{ status, role, note? }` — vendor transitions enforced; auto-fills date columns and sets `exceptionFlag` on `issue_flagged`.
- `POST /orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/exception` `{ flag, reason?, notes? }`
- `POST /orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/dates` `{ supplierDueDate?, supplierShipDate?, supplierDeliveryDate?, supplierInstallDate?, supplierReference?, supplierNotes? }`
- `GET /orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/history` — `{ assignments[], statuses[] }` with supplier names.
- `GET /orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/supplier-recommendations` — ranked by inheritance source then active suppliers.
- `GET /fulfillment/command-center` — line-item-grain results joined with order/partner/event/supplier; filters: `supplierId, status, partnerId, portalType, eventId, cityId, fulfillmentMode, shortageOnly, issueOnly, unassignedOnly, dueWithinDays, hasQuoteSpec`; stats: `unassigned, awaitingAcknowledge, dueSoon (≤7d), awaitingAssets, issues, shippedNotDelivered, installUpcoming, completedToday, missingQuoteSpec, withShortage`.
- `GET /vendor/orders?supplierId` — orders containing items for that supplier; each order is filtered to only the supplier's items (no margins, no internal notes; vendor notes only).
- `GET /vendor/items?supplierId&bucket=all|due_soon|awaiting_assets|in_production|issues|recent` — vendor dashboard with bucket counts.
- `GET /vendor/orders/:orderId/packet?supplierId` — clean printable packet (order header, ship-to, items, products, vendor-visible quote assets only).

### UI surfaces
- `/admin/fulfillment` — Fulfillment Command Center: clickable stat cards (toggle filters), filter rail, line-item table with inline status pill, due-date editor, exception toggle, bulk supplier assignment.
- `/admin/orders/:id` — OrderDetail items now have `ItemSupplierControls` per row: supplier picker (override-confirm prompt when overriding inherited), source badge, status pill, due-date popover, supplier reference inline editor, exception flag/clear; checkboxes enable bulk supplier assignment toolbar.
- `/admin/vendor` — Vendor Workspace: supplier perspective switcher + bucket tabs (All / Due in 7d / Awaiting Assets / In Production / Issues), vendor-only status transitions, click any item to open Packet View (printable, includes vendor-visible quote assets and ship-to).
- Sidebar nav adds "Fulfillment" link next to Orders.

## ERP, Export & Reconciliation Layer (April 2026)

Adds a finance/ops bridge on top of orders so daily ops can be exported into the supplier-facing or NetSuite-facing world, and so commission verification and discrepancy handling have a real workspace. **Extends** existing tables — does not rebuild any prior feature.

### Schema (`lib/db/src/schema/orders.ts`, `lib/db/src/schema/reconciliation.ts`)
- `orders` extended with: `paymentModel` (partner_billed | client_direct | a3_billed | prepaid), `billingEntity`, `supplierEstimatedCost`, `supplierFinalCost`, `expectedCommission`, `paidCommission`, `commissionPaidDate`, `commissionPaidThrough`, `commissionStatus` (not_started | expected | partially_paid | paid | disputed | verified), `supplierPayableStatus` (not_started | invoiced | paid | overdue), `payoutStatus`, `reconciliationStatus` (not_started | in_review | waiting_payment | waiting_supplier_final | waiting_commission | discrepancy_found | reconciled), `reconciliationNotes`, `financeNotes`.
- `order_items` extended with `estimatedSupplierCost`, `finalSupplierCost`.
- New `discrepancies` table — orderId, type (supplier_cost_variance | commission_variance | billing_mismatch | missing_payment | missing_supplier_final | wrong_billing_model | missing_quote_ref | shortage_unresolved | manual_review), severity, status (open | in_review | resolved | wont_fix), reason, notes, expected/actual/varianceAmount, assignedToUserId, resolutionNotes, autoFlagged.
- New `commission_payouts` table — orderId, amount, paidDate, paidThrough, reference, notes; recording a payout auto-recomputes the order's `paidCommission` total and bumps `commissionStatus` (paid / partially_paid / disputed).

### Backend exports (`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/exports.ts`)
- `GET /api/exports/orders.csv?...filters` — order-level export with retail, costs, commission columns, variance, billing entity (NetSuite/spreadsheet preset).
- `GET /api/exports/order-items.csv?...filters` — line-item export with supplier, fulfillment mode, demand, reservations, shortages, supplier cost, ops notes, and quote/spec references.
- `GET /api/exports/finance.csv?...filters` — finance/recon preset: gross margin, commission variance, statuses, open discrepancies.
- `GET /api/exports/suppliers.csv` — supplier rollup (assignment count, due-soon, issues, supplier cost totals).
- `GET /api/exports/events.csv` — event rollup (reserved/shortage/orders/booked).
- `GET /api/exports/orders/:id/packet.html?supplierId=` — printable Operational Packet (full order) or Supplier Packet (scoped to one supplier's items + ship-to). Includes Quote/Spec references attached to each product.
- `GET /api/exports/suppliers/:id/packet.html` — printable supplier packet across all their assignments.
- All CSVs filter via the same querystring shape used by the Orders dashboard, so filter→export workflows share the same model.

### Backend reconciliation (`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/reconciliation.ts`)
- `GET /api/reconciliation/summary` — totals, awaiting count, variance totals, breakdowns by billing model and recon status.
- `GET /api/reconciliation/orders?...filters` — decorated list (partner/event/supplier names, gross margin, commission variance, supplier cost variance, open discrepancy count, embedded discrepancies). Filters: partnerId, supplierId, paymentModel, paymentStatus, supplierPayableStatus, reconciliationStatus, commissionStatus, plus toggle filters `discrepancyOnly`, `missingSupplierFinal`, `missingCommissionVerification`, `missingPaymentConfirmation`.
- `PATCH /api/reconciliation/orders/:id` — update billing/cost/commission/recon fields and notes (zod-validated).
- `POST /api/reconciliation/orders/:id/auto-flag` — heuristic flagger: emits `commission_variance` (paid ≠ expected), `supplier_cost_variance` (>5% from estimate), `missing_payment` (completed but unpaid), `missing_supplier_final` (delivered/completed without final cost). Skips if same auto-flag already open.
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/discrepancies` — CRUD with order# / partner decoration. Status update auto-stamps `resolvedAt`.
- `GET /api/orders/:id/commission-payouts`, `POST /api/orders/:id/commission-payouts`, `DELETE /api/orders/:id/commission-payouts/:payoutId` — payout history with auto-recompute of order paidCommission/status.
- `POST /api/reconciliation/bulk-update` — apply patch to many orders.

### UI surfaces
- `/admin/reconciliation` — Reconciliation Workspace (`pages/admin/Reconciliation.tsx`):
  - 5 summary cards (retail booked, supplier final cost, commission paid, awaiting recon, open discrepancies) tinted by health.
  - Tabs: **Orders** (filterable table with retail/cost-with-arrow/margin/commission columns, recon + issue badges), **Discrepancies** (severity, inline status select, delete), **Commission** (verification table with auto-flag-all button).
  - Side drawer per order: sub-totals, full Billing & Costs + Reconciliation form, embedded discrepancy list, commission payout history with inline add form, "Open in OrderDetail" + "Packet" shortcuts.
  - "Export finance CSV" honors active filters.
- `/admin/orders/:id` — OrderDetail now shows:
  - **Ops Packet** + (when supplier assigned) **Supplier Packet** buttons next to Print, opening printable HTML in new tabs.
  - **Finance & Reconciliation** card in the right column (margin/variance/issues mini-stats, full editable finance form, embedded discrepancy mini-list, commission payout history, link to the Reconciliation workspace).
- `/admin/orders` — header now has an **Export ▾** menu (Orders CSV / Line items CSV / Finance CSV with current filters; plus suppliers and events rollups).
- Sidebar nav adds "Reconciliation" with Calculator icon between Fulfillment and Suppliers.

### Visibility / role gating
All finance fields and the Reconciliation workspace live exclusively under `/admin/*` which is gated by `AdminRoute` (Clerk). Partner managers, vendors, and clients use distinct surfaces (vendor portal, public partner portal) and never see commission, supplier cost, or reconciliation status.

**Known gap (consistent with rest of API):** API routes themselves are not yet role-gated server-side; the codebase relies on frontend `AdminRoute` for access control across all admin endpoints (orders, suppliers, finance, exports). To harden, add a `requireAdmin` express middleware that reads the Clerk session and a user→role lookup, then mount it on `/exports*`, `/reconciliation*`, `/discrepancies*`, `/orders/:id/commission-payouts*`, and other sensitive routes. This requires the frontend `apiFetch` to forward the Clerk session token (currently it does not).

### Hardening applied in this layer
- CSV cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab, or carriage-return are prefixed with `'` to defuse Excel/Sheets formula injection from user-controlled fields (names, notes, emails).
- `supplierId` and `assignedSupplierId` are both accepted by export filters so the dashboard's filter shape works end-to-end for supplier-scoped CSVs.
- Commission payout DELETE recomputes `paidCommission` **and** `commissionStatus` (paid / partially_paid / disputed / expected / not_started), matching the POST recompute path.
- Auto-flag emits `commission_variance` whenever `expectedCommission > 0` and paid differs from expected (including paid=0 case).

## Selective Billing Execution & Invoice Workflow (April 2026)

A formal billing layer that decides — per order — *who* invoices the client and how, then tracks the resulting invoice through its full lifecycle. Sits on top of (does not replace) Reconciliation, which still tracks supplier costs/commissions/payouts.

### Five billing execution models
- `a3_collected` — A3 invoices and collects from end client.
- `alyssa_entity_collected` — A separate Alyssa entity invoices/collects.
- `manual_invoice` — Off-system (PDF/email) invoice; mark sent/paid manually.
- `split_payout` — Placeholder for future split payouts to multiple parties.
- `external_payment_pending` — Client pays via external system (Stripe/QBO link); waiting on confirmation.

### Inheritance precedence (resolver)
order override (orders.billingExecModel where source='order') → event override (events.billingExecModelOverride) → partner default (partners.defaultBillingExecModel) → fallback `a3_collected`. Resolver lives in `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/billingResolver.ts` and is called by `/api/billing/orders/:id/resolve` and the auto-resolution on invoice creation.

### Schema additions
- `partners`: defaultBillingExecModel, billingEntityName, paymentTerms, depositRequired, depositPct, allowPartialPayment, allowOrderOverride, defaultBillingNotes, billingContactName/Email/Phone, internalBillingOwnerUserId, billingActive.
- `events`: billingExecModelOverride.
- `orders`: billingExecModel, billingExecModelSource (`partner|event|order`), invoiceRequired, internalBillingOwnerUserId, billingReferenceNumber, externalInvoiceRef, paymentLinkPlaceholder, billingNotes, billingContactJson.
- `invoices`: invoiceNumber, publicToken (random 32-hex for `/invoice/:token`), orderId, partnerId, eventId, billingExecModel, billingEntity, status, issueDate/dueDate, subtotal/tax/totalAmount/amountPaid/balanceDue, depositAmount/depositPaid, lineItemsJson, billingContactJson, paymentInstructions, externalInvoiceRef, paymentLinkPlaceholder, internalReference, notes, createdByUserId, sentAt/paidAt/cancelledAt.
- `invoice_payments`: invoiceId, amount, paidDate, method, reference, isDeposit, notes, recordedByUserId.

### Invoice statuses
`draft → ready → sent → partially_paid|paid|overdue|cancelled`. Recording a payment auto-recomputes amountPaid/balanceDue, transitions status, and mirrors `orders.paymentStatus`. `POST /api/invoices/scan-overdue` flips `sent` past dueDate to `overdue`.

### API routes
- `/api/billing/summary` — totals, overdue count, ordersNeedingInvoice, missingBillingContact, byStatus, byBilling.
- `/api/billing/orders` — filterable list with resolved billing model + linked invoice meta. Filters: billingExecModel, invoiceStatus, paymentStatus, partnerId, needsInvoice, overdueOnly, missingBillingContact.
- `/api/billing/orders/:id/resolve` — return resolved model + source.
- `/api/billing/orders/:id/override` — set/clear order-level override.
- `/api/billing/bulk` — bulk create_invoices / mark_ready / mark_sent / mark_overdue.
- `/api/invoices` (GET list w/ filters, POST not exposed — use `from-order`), `/api/invoices/:id` (GET, PATCH), `/api/invoices/from-order/:orderId` (POST), `/api/invoices/:id/regenerate` (POST — pull current order line items into draft), `/api/invoices/:id/payments` (POST/DELETE), `/api/invoices/public/:token` (public client view), `/api/invoices/scan-overdue` (POST cron-like).

### Frontend
- `/admin/billing` — Billing Command Center (5 summary cards, filters, Orders/Invoices tabs, bulk actions, scan-overdue).
- `/admin/invoices/:id` — line items + payments + status workflow + edit panel + "Open client view" link.
- `/invoice/:token` — public, print-friendly client-facing invoice (no auth).
- OrderDetail right column has a Billing card showing resolved model + source pill, model override dropdown, invoice link or Create-invoice button.
- PartnerForm has a Billing Settings card (default model, terms, billing entity, deposit %, billing contact, allow-override flags).

### Notes
- `order_items` has no `lineTotal` column — invoice line item amounts are computed as `quantity * unitPrice` at create/regenerate time and stored in `invoices.lineItemsJson`.
- Numeric fields come back from Drizzle as strings; resolver and totals coerce via `parseFloat`.
- Authz follows the same convention as the rest of the admin API (frontend gates via Clerk `AdminRoute`; backend trusts admin-net traffic). Public invoice endpoint is intentionally unauthenticated and looks up only by random 32-hex token.

## Asset & Production Workflow (April 2026)

A unified asset model layered on top of the existing portal. Replaces ad-hoc `artworkFileUrl` / `artworkFilesJson` with structured, versioned, approval-gated assets.

### Schema (`lib/db/src/schema/assets.ts`)
- **`assets`** — title, fileUrl, fileName, mimeType, fileSize, category (`client_artwork`, `approved_artwork`, `proof`, `print_ready`, `reference`, `install_reference`, `shipping_document`, `photo`, `spec`, `internal_only`), visibility (`internal_only` | `partner_visible` | `client_visible` | `vendor_visible`), polymorphic `ownerType`/`ownerId` plus dedicated FKs to partner / event / order / product / package / brandingZone / supplier. Versioning: `version`, `isCurrent`, `parentAssetId`. Lifecycle: `status` (`uploaded` | `under_review` | `revision_requested` | `approved` | `superseded` | `vendor_released` | `archived`), `approvalStatus`, `approvedByUserId`, `approvedAt`, `releasedToVendorAt`, `productionReady`. Plus `uploadedByUserId`, `notes`, `tagsJson`.
- **`asset_links`** — many-to-many between an asset and `order_items` with `role` (primary_artwork, proof, reference, install_diagram, shipping_doc) and `isRequiredFor` flag. Same asset can map to multiple line items.
- **`asset_events`** — full audit trail. Auto-emitted on every transition (uploaded, linked, unlinked, new_version, approved, revision_requested, released_to_vendor, status_change, visibility_change, archived).
- **`order_items`** extended with `artworkRequired`, `proofRequired`, `productionReady`, `productionBlockedReason`.

### Backend
- **`/api/assets`** (`routes/assets.ts`):
  - `GET /assets` — list with filters: partnerId, eventId, orderId, productId, brandingZoneId, supplierId, category, status, visibility, currentOnly, approvedOnly, orderItemId.
  - `GET /assets/:id` — includes `links`, `events`, full `versions[]` history (root + children).
  - `POST /assets` — create after upload; optionally `linkOrderItemIds[]`.
  - `PATCH /assets/:id` — title, category, visibility, status, approvalStatus, productionReady, notes, tags, isCurrent. Logs status & visibility changes.
  - `POST /assets/:id/approve` — sets approved + approvedAt + (default) `vendor_released` + `vendor_visible`. Pass `releaseToVendor:false` to approve without releasing.
  - `POST /assets/:id/request-revision` — flips to `revision_requested`, logs note.
  - `POST /assets/:id/new-version` — supersedes the family, creates v(n+1), copies links forward.
  - `POST /assets/:id/links` / `DELETE /assets/:id/links/:linkId` — manage line-item mapping.
  - `DELETE /assets/:id` — archive.
  - `GET /asset-events` — recent feed.
- **`/api/production`** (`routes/production.ts`):
  - `GET /orders/:id/readiness` — per-line-item readiness with `expectations` (needsArtwork/needsProof — derived from `fulfillmentMode`, product capabilities, presence of brandingZone), `assets[]`, `flags[]` (`artwork_missing`, `artwork_awaiting_approval`, `proof_missing`, `proof_awaiting_approval`, `exception`, `blocked`), `productionReady`, plus rolled-up `summary` (total/ready/blocked/missingArtwork/missingProof/awaitingApproval).
  - `PATCH /order-items/:id/production-block` — set/clear `productionBlockedReason`.
  - `GET /production/dashboard` — counters (awaitingReview, awaitingApproval, revisionRequested, approved, vendorReleased, superseded), latest uploads, byEvent / bySupplier counts, orderIssues list.
  - `GET /orders/:orderId/supplier-packet/:supplierId` — vendor-safe production handoff: only items assigned to that supplier, only assets that are `isCurrent` + `vendor_visible` (or `client_visible`) + approved-or-released. Includes due/ship/install dates, internal fulfillment notes, blocked reason, per-item flags, plus order-level approved vendor-visible assets.

### Frontend
- **`/admin/production`** (`Production.tsx`) — review dashboard: 6 counter cards, "Orders with asset issues" list, "Latest uploads", assets-by-event, assets-by-supplier.
- **`/admin/assets`** (`Assets.tsx`) — global asset library with search, status & category filters, inline uploader.
- **`/admin/orders/:orderId/packet/:supplierId`** (`SupplierPacket.tsx`) — printable production packet (calls supplier-packet endpoint). Print stylesheet hides chrome; per-item ready/blocked badges; clearly groups vendor-released assets.
- **`OrderDetail`** Production Assets card — embeds `OrderAssetsPanel` (readiness summary + supplier packet links + order-level assets section + per-line-item mapping). Legacy `artworkFilesJson` shown beneath as "Legacy attachments".
- **`AssetUploader`** — drag/drop or click; calls existing `/api/storage/uploads/request-url` flow (presigned PUT to GCS, then POST `/api/assets`); category + visibility selects; `compact` mode for inline use.
- **`AssetCard`** — image thumbnail / file icon, status + approval + visibility + category badges, action menu: View, Approve & release, Approve only, Request revision (with notes), Upload new version (in-place), Release to vendor, Archive.
- **`OrderAssetsPanel`** — readiness card with summary badges, links to per-supplier packets, order-level assets grid, line-item cards with: needs-artwork/needs-proof expectations, current assets list with role / version / approval / vendor-released chips, link existing or upload new (auto-mapped), block/unblock controls.
- Nav: new "Production" item in `AdminLayout` between Fulfillment and Billing.

### Vendor-leak gating (defense in depth)
- `PATCH /assets/:id` rejects `status: "vendor_released"` or `visibility: "vendor_visible"` unless the asset is (or is being set in the same call to) `approvalStatus: "approved"`.
- Supplier packet endpoint requires `isCurrent && visibility === "vendor_visible" && approvalStatus === "approved"` — no status-only shortcut.
- `new-version` always demotes `vendor_visible` → `internal_only` on the new draft so it must be re-approved before reaching vendors.

### Versioning (transactional)
- `POST /assets/:id/new-version` runs in a DB transaction. It computes `nextVersion = max(version)+1` across the entire family (root + children), supersedes every member, copies links from the current head (not the asset called against), and inserts the new draft as `isCurrent`. Calling from an older version still produces a correctly numbered new head.

### Link integrity
- `POST /assets/:id/links` de-dupes on `(assetId, orderItemId, role)`.
- `DELETE /assets/:id/links/:linkId` requires the link to belong to that asset (returns 404 otherwise).

### Visibility / role model
- Internal admins see everything in the admin UI.
- `vendor_visible` + approved-or-released + isCurrent — what vendors see in supplier packet.
- `client_visible` — surfaced to client / partner views (existing partner portal).
- `internal_only` — never leaves the admin UI.
- Vendor packet endpoint hard-filters by visibility AND approval, so unapproved or internal assets never leak even if linked.

### Readiness heuristics
A line item is `productionReady` iff:
- if expected to need artwork → an `isCurrent`+`approved` primary_artwork link exists, AND
- if expected to need proof → an `isCurrent`+`approved` proof link exists, AND
- no `productionBlockedReason` set.
Expectations come from `fulfillmentMode` (`graphic_only` / `rental_plus_print` / `full` → needs artwork), product `capabilitiesJson` (`printable`, `proofRequired`), or presence of `brandingZoneId`.

### Versioning
- New version supersedes all prior in family (sets `isCurrent=false`, `status=superseded` for active prior states).
- Links carry forward to the new version.
- Version history surfaced via `GET /assets/:id` `versions[]`.

### Activity / audit
Every transition writes to `asset_events`. Surfaced in `GET /assets/:id.events` and `GET /asset-events`. Existing `supplier_status_events` is preserved unchanged.

### What's not in this pass (next phase)
- Outbound communications wiring (revision-requested → email, vendor-release → email). Hook points exist in `asset_events`.
- Client-facing asset upload page and missing-file reminder flows.
- Required-asset rules per product/zone (currently inferred from fulfillmentMode + capabilities).
- Seed data updated to demonstrate the new asset workflow.

## Workflow Automation & Orchestration (April 2026)

Layered on top of reconciliation, billing, fulfillment, supplier routing, and the asset/artwork workflow. Operational nerve center for the portal.

### Schema (`lib/db/src/schema/workflow.ts`)
- `workflow_rules` — name, triggerType, objectType, conditionsJson, actionsJson, priority, escalationLevel, isActive, isSystem.
- `workflow_tasks` — title, category, status (open/in_progress/snoozed/completed/cancelled), priority, deadlineHealth (on_track/due_soon/at_risk/overdue/blocked), escalationLevel, ownerUserId, dueDate, links to partner/event/order/orderItem/supplier/invoice/asset, autoCreated, sourceRuleId, dedupeKey.
- `workflow_alerts` — title, severity (info/warning/critical), message, links, isRead, isResolved, autoCreated, sourceRuleId, dedupeKey.
- `workflow_audit` — eventType (rule_fired, task_created, alert_created, task_completed, override_applied, etc.), summary, detailsJson, isAutomated, sourceRuleId, objectType/objectId, overrideNote.

### Engine (`artifacts/api-server/src/services/workflowEngine.ts`)
- `fire(triggerType, ctx)` loads active rules, evaluates conditions (`all`/`any` with eq/neq/gt/gte/lt/lte/in/exists/missing comparators), runs actions, audits everything.
- Action handlers: `create_task`, `create_alert`, `draft_communication`, `set_priority`, `flag_blocked`, `log_audit`.
- `{var}` interpolation in titles/messages from ctx.
- Dedupe by `rule:{ruleId}:{linkedObjectType}:{linkedObjectId}` — open/unresolved matches are skipped so re-firing is idempotent.
- 10 default rules seeded automatically when `workflow_rules` is empty (missing artwork follow-up, supplier unassigned, asset awaiting approval, revision follow-up, production blocked escalation, invoice sent confirmation, overdue invoice chase, event readiness check, deadline approaching vendor reminder, recon discrepancy follow-up).

### Deadline ticker (`services/deadlineMonitor.ts`)
- Boots at +5s, sweeps every 60s (configurable via `WORKFLOW_TICK_MS`).
- Sweeps invoices (overdue / due-soon by `dueDate`), orders (`supplierDueDate`), events (eventStartDate||installDate within 21d), and stale pending assets (>24h old).
- Fires `deadline.approaching` / `deadline.overdue` / `event.approaching` / `invoice.overdue` / `asset.awaiting_approval`.

### Hooks wired
- assets: `asset.uploaded`, `asset.approved`, `asset.revision_requested`.
- production block/unblock: `production.blocked` / `production.unblocked` with override-note audit.
- invoices: `invoice.sent` (on status patch), `invoice.overdue` (per-row in scan-overdue).
- orders submitted/approved + supplier assignment hooks: TODO (ticker compensates by sweeping `supplierDueDate`).

### Override flow
PATCH `/api/order-items/:id/production-block` accepts `overrideNote`. When clearing a blocked reason with a note, an `override_applied` audit entry is written carrying the note, visible in the activity log and rendered in the dashboard with an italic "Override:" caption.

### Backend routes (`/api/workflow/*`)
- `rules` — GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, `:id/toggle`, `:id/duplicate`.
- `tasks` — GET (with filters: status, ownerUserId, partnerId, eventId, orderId, supplierId, invoiceId, assetId, autoCreated, deadlineHealth, escalationLevel, priority, status=open_any), POST, PATCH, `:id/complete`, `:id/snooze` (deadlineHealth recomputed on the fly).
- `alerts` — GET, `:id/read`, `:id/resolve`.
- `audit` — GET (filter by linked object).
- `queue` — consolidated counters + tasks + alerts for dashboard.
- `override` — manual override with required note.
- `fire` / `tick` — debug endpoints to manually fire triggers / run a sweep.

### Frontend
- `/admin/workflow` — orchestration dashboard with 7 counter cards (open, overdue, due_soon, urgent, escalated, alerts, critical) and tabs: All / Overdue / Due soon / Escalated / Alerts / Activity / Rules. Each task row shows priority badge, deadline-health badge, auto badge, escalation, category, due date, linked object, snooze (+1d), Done.
- `/admin/workflow/rules` — full CRUD grouped by trigger, JSON editors for conditions/actions, system-rule protection (no delete), enable/disable, duplicate.
- `TaskPanel` component embedded into OrderDetail and InvoiceDetail; lists open tasks for the record with quick complete / snooze / inline add.
- "Workflow" nav link added to AdminLayout.

### Role permissions
- All workflow routes are admin-protected via existing AdminRoute / requireAdmin chain. No partner-portal exposure.

### Next phase
- Wire `order.submitted` / `order.approved` / `supplier.assigned` hooks in orders/suppliers routes.
- Status guardrails service consumed by asset approval and invoice send.
- Per-portal-type rule scoping via `portalTypes` array.
- Owner assignment + email digest delivery.

## Executive Analytics & Profitability Intelligence (April 2026)

In-app analytics layer answering revenue, profitability, supplier performance, forecast, and operational risk questions for Super Admin / Internal Admin. Aggregates current operational tables (orders, orderItems, invoices, invoicePayments, partners, events, suppliers, packages, productCatalog, partnerBrandingLocations, cities, venues) — no separate warehouse.

### Service (`artifacts/api-server/src/services/analytics.ts`)
- `loadWorkspace(filters)` — single batched fetch, builds `Map`s for joins, applies order-level filters (date range, partner, portalType, cityId, supplierId, billingExecModel). Excludes `cancelled` orders.
- `orderMetrics(o, ws)` — per-order snapshot: retail, est/final cost, est/actual margin, expected/paid commission, commission variance, invoiced/collected/outstanding, blocked-item / shortage-item counts.
- `kpis(filters)` — totals + counts for Overview KPIs (retail, invoiced, collected, est/actual margin, commission variance, blocked, shortages, discrepancies, overdue invoices, upcoming and at-risk events) + status/billing-model breakdowns.
- `profitability(dimension, filters)` — buckets revenue + margin + commission by `partner | event | city | portalType | billingModel | supplier | package | zone | productCategory`. Package/zone/productCategory roll up at line-item level; others at order level.
- `supplierPerformance(filters)` — order-level revenue + cost + variance plus item-level blocked/shortage/missing-artwork/overdue/due-soon counts; computes `issueRate = (blocked+shortage+overdue)/items`.
- `packageAnalytics`, `zoneAnalytics`, `productAnalytics` — package/zone/product detail tables with retail, margin, qty, print-only vs full-unit demand mix, shortage/missing-artwork exposure.
- `forecast(filters)` — horizon buckets (next 30/60/90 days) by event start; pipeline stages derived from current state: `confirmed | awaiting_approval | awaiting_assets | awaiting_billing | at_risk | delayed`.
- `risk(filters)` — exposure across blocked orders, blocked items, shortages, missing artwork, unassigned items, overdue invoices, unreconciled, commission discrepancies, events approaching with readiness issues; computes `revenueAtRisk` (sum of retail tied to any order with a risk flag).
- `trends(filters, granularity)` — month/week/day buckets of retail, est/actual cost, est/actual margin, expected/paid commission.
- `toCsv(rows)` — generic CSV serializer used by export.

### Routes (`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/analytics.ts`, mounted at `/api`)
- `GET /api/analytics/kpis`
- `GET /api/analytics/profitability?dimension=...`
- `GET /api/analytics/suppliers`
- `GET /api/analytics/packages` · `/zones` · `/products`
- `GET /api/analytics/forecast`
- `GET /api/analytics/risk`
- `GET /api/analytics/trends?granularity=day|week|month`
- `GET /api/analytics/export?view=profitability|suppliers|packages|zones|products|trends&dimension=...`
- All endpoints accept the same filter set: `from`, `to`, `partnerId`, `portalType`, `cityId`, `supplierId`, `billingExecModel`.

### Frontend (`artifacts/a3-portal/src/pages/admin/Analytics.tsx`, route `/admin/analytics`)
- Single page with sticky filter bar and 6 tabs:
  - **Overview** — 16 KPI cards plus 4 charts (retail vs cost area, margin line, commission bars, status/billing pies).
  - **Profitability** — switchable across 9 dimensions; sortable table with margin %, commission variance, open A/R, average order value; CSV export.
  - **Suppliers** — top-5 by revenue + highest issue-rate bar charts; full performance table with cost variance and issue %; CSV export.
  - **Packages / zones / products** — three sortable tables with per-section CSV exports; product table shows print-only vs full-unit mix + shortage exposure.
  - **Forecast** — 30/60/90-day horizon cards (retail, est. cost, est. margin, expected commission, event count); pipeline stage table.
  - **Risk** — revenue-at-risk hero card, 9 risk count tiles, and 6 drill-list cards with deep-links into orders/invoices.
- All risk-list rows link into `/admin/orders/:id` or `/admin/invoices/:id` via wouter.
- Nav: "Analytics" item added to AdminLayout (BarChart3 icon), positioned between Workflow and Billing.

### Metric definitions (consistent across cards & tables)
- estimated gross margin = retail − supplier estimated cost
- actual gross margin = retail − (supplier final cost OR supplier estimated cost if final not yet recorded)
- commission variance = expected commission − paid commission
- revenue at risk = retail of any order with at least one blocked / shortage / missing-artwork item
- forecast retail = total retail of orders whose linked event start date falls inside the horizon
- open receivables = sum of `invoices.balanceDue` for non-cancelled invoices

### Role visibility
- Routes are mounted under the same router as workflow/reconciliation; the page is only registered behind `AdminRoute`, so only Super Admin / Internal Admin can reach it. Vendor and client roles never see the nav item or page. Per-partner partner-manager analytics are out of scope for this pass — server filters already accept `partnerId`, so partner-scoped surfaces can plug in later.

### Next phase
- Save filter views per user.
- Add city × billing-model heatmap and partner trend sparklines on the Overview tab.
- Wire forecast horizon cards to drill into the underlying order list.
- Per-partner-manager dashboard scoped to their partnerId (route-level role gate already supports it via filters).

## Launch Polish & Onboarding (April 2026)
### What was added
- **Schema**: `partners.launchStatus` (draft/preview/internal_only/live/paused), `launchedAt`, `launchOverrideNote`, `demoFlag`, `setupTemplate`. New `onboarding_progress` table tracking per-user step completion.
- **Backend (`launchReadiness.ts`)**: per-partner readiness checklist across Branding / Contacts / Locations / Catalog / Billing / Fulfillment / Rollout (blocker vs warning), platform-level readiness summary, and `setLaunchStatus()` that flips `partners.isActive` on live/paused transitions.
- **Routes (`/api/launch/*`, `/api/onboarding/*`)**:
  - `GET /api/launch/platform` — global readiness card data
  - `GET /api/launch/partner/:id` — per-partner checklist with completionPct, blocker/warning counts, readyToLaunch flag
  - `POST /api/launch/partner/:id/activate` — change launch state. Returns 409 + requiresOverride when blockers present and no `overrideNote` was supplied; the override note is persisted on `launchOverrideNote` and audited.
  - `GET/POST /api/onboarding/progress`, `POST /api/onboarding/dismiss` for first-use checklists.
- **Frontend**:
  - `/admin/launch` — multi-step Launch Wizard with sidebar nav and live platform-readiness card.
  - `RolloutChecklist` component embedded at the top of the partner edit page, showing status badge, progress bar, grouped checklist with deep-links, and an override-note dialog when launching despite blockers.
  - `LaunchBanner` on the Dashboard nudges admins toward the wizard until the first partner is live and platform readiness hits 100%.
  - Reusable `EmptyStateCard` for first-use empty states.
- **Nav**: "Launch" item (Rocket icon) in AdminLayout between Analytics and Billing.

### Launch state semantics
- **draft** — internal only, not addressable
- **preview** — private preview link sharable
- **internal_only** — staff sees portal, public does not
- **live** — fully launched (also flips `partners.isActive=true`)
- **paused** — temporarily disabled (flips `isActive=false`)

### Override flow
Launching a partner with outstanding blockers requires an `overrideNote` string. The note is stored on `partners.launchOverrideNote` and surfaced in the rollout checklist UI.

## Post-Launch Optimization Layer

Built on top of the launch system to track adoption, friction, feedback, and partner health after go-live.

**Schema (`lib/db/src/schema/usage.ts`)**
- `usage_events` — eventType, partnerId?, userId?, role?, objectType?, objectId?, meta jsonb, occurredAt. Indexed by partner+type+time.
- `feedback_items` — submitterUserId/Role, partnerId?, screenPath, category (ux/bug/performance/missing_feature/data/onboarding/billing/other), severity, message, status (new/triaged/in_progress/resolved/wontfix), tags[], assignedTo, internalNotes, resolvedAt.

**Services**
- `usageTracking.ts` — `emit(eventType, ctx)` (fire-and-forget), `emitFirst(eventType, ctx)` (idempotent per partner+type), `firstEventAt`, `summary`, `timeline`.
- `partnerHealth.ts` — `computePartnerHealth(partnerId)` returns `{status, score 0-100, signals[], metrics}`. Score blends launchReadiness, open workflow_tasks, unresolved alerts, recent activity, and staleness. Statuses: not_started / onboarding / live_fragile / active / healthy / at_risk.

**Usage hooks wired** — partners.ts (partner.created), orders.ts (order.submitted, first_order_submitted, order.status.*, first_order_completed), assets.ts (asset.approved, first_asset_approved), invoices.ts (invoice.sent, first_invoice_sent).
